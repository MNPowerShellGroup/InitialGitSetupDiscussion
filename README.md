# InitialGitSetupDiscussion
Discussion on initial setup and how and what we want to share

* Create repository for monthly meetings code
* Create repository for monthly anouncments
* Could use the wiki option within the repository as well
* cool thought:  Can we write powershell to push from Git and update our website for content?
* Does Git Pages make sense?
>* Maybe not everywhere, but does it make sense for a portion?
