Discussion on initial setup and how and what we want to share

* Create repository for code demoed in monthly meeting
* Create repository for monthly anouncements
* Could use the wiki option within the repository as well
* cool thought:  Can we write powershell to push from Git and update our website for content?
* Does Git Pages make sense?
>* Maybe not everywhere, but does it make sense for a portion?
